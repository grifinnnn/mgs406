# MGS406 Final Project

Hello!

This is my final project for MGS406 Spring 2023 Semester. I created a simple web application which acts as an helpdesk ticketing system.

Users can submit their helpdesk tickets with their priority and problem, and that data will be stored in an SQL database. IT personnel can then see a list of open tickets and resolve them as needed, which will change their status in the SQL database and take them off the list.

For the front end user interface I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 

For the back-end, I used Python, Flask, and SQL.
